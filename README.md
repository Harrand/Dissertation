# Dissertation
Two repositories (Engine A and Engine B) comprise the programming section of the dissertation. Both of these repositories are a fork of a specific commit of the Topaz engine. This project claims technical contribution for all three repositories, as all were made by myself, from scratch, unless specifically specified in the dissertation.
